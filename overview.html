                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The application provides a platform for generating Google Dorks tailored to Bug Bounty hunters and students. Users select their role from a dropdown menu, which dynamically updates available dork types. Bug Bounty hunters can access a range of security-related dorks for vulnerability searches, while students are offered dorks related to academic resources. After choosing a role and dork type, users input search terms to generate and display specific Google Dork queries. The results appear in a terminal-style output, with the option to open the first result directly in a new tab. This functionality enables efficient and targeted search query creation based on user needs.</p>
    
                <h2>Functionality Overview:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role Selection:</strong> Users can select their role from a dropdown menu, which updates another dropdown menu with relevant dork options. For Bug Bounty hunters, a comprehensive list of dork types related to security testing is available, including searches for vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, and open redirects. Students, on the other hand, have options for academic resources like free courses, research papers, and dissertations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dork Generation:</strong> Once a role and dork type are selected, users can enter a search term, and the application generates Google Dork queries based on their inputs. The generated dorks are displayed in a terminal-like output area, where each dork is a clickable link that opens a Google search for the term.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search button triggers the generation and display of dorks. Additionally, the first generated dork is set to open in a new tab automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> The terminal box updates dynamically as users interact with the dropdown menus and input fields, providing real-time feedback and query generation.</li>
                </ul>
